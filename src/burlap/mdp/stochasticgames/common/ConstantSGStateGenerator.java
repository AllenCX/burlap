 * A stochastic games state generator that always returns the same base state, which is specified via the constructor. The

 * This generator will automatically reassign the relevant OO-MDP object names to the names of each agent by querying the agent type
 * and agent name in the list of agents provides to the {@link #generateState(List)} method. This reassignment is done
 * each time the {@link #generateState(List)} method is called on a copy of the originally provided state.
