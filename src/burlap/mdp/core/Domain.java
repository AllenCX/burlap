/**
 * This is the base class for a problem domain. A problem domain consists of its state variables, as defined with an
 * OO-MDP ({@link burlap.mdp.core.Attribute}s, {@link burlap.mdp.core.ObjectClass}s, and {@link PropositionalFunction}s),
 * and the physics of the world, which are typically specified with some set of action definitions. For single-agent
 * domains, the physics and actions are defined with the {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.Action} object and for
 * multi-agent stochastic games, they are defined with {@link burlap.mdp.stochasticgames.agentactions.SGAgentAction} and a
 * {@link burlap.mdp.stochasticgames.JointActionModel}. See the respective single-agent {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.SADomain}
 * and stochastic games {@link burlap.mdp.stochasticgames.SGDomain} subclasses for more information on their definitions.
 * <p>
 * Note that a {@link burlap.mdp.core.Domain} does *not* include task information, which will be defined separately with
 * a {@link burlap.mdp.singleagent.RewardFunction} or {@link burlap.mdp.stochasticgames.JointReward}, and a {@link burlap.mdp.core.TerminalFunction}.
