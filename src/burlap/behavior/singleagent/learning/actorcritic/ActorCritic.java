/**
 * This is a general class structure for implementing Actor-critic learning. The kind of actor critic learning performed
 * can be modified by swapping out different {@link Actor} and {@link Critic} objects. The general structure of the 
 * learning algorithm is for the {@link Actor} class to be queried for an action given the current state of the world.
 * That action is taken and a resulting state is observed. The {@link Critic} is then asked to critique this behavior
 * which is returned in a {@link CritiqueResult} object and then passed along to the {@link Actor} so that the actor may
 * update is behavior accordingly.
