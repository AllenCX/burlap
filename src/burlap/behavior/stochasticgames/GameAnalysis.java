/**
 * This class provides a means to record all the interactions in a stochastic game; specifically, the sequence of states, joint actions taken, and joint reward received.
 * It also has methods to converting everything to a string/file and parsing a string/file back into this object so that results can be recorded and saved to disk.
 * <p>
 * This class should be used either by constructing with an initial state ({@link #GameAnalysis(State)}) or by constructing with the default constructor and then
 * using the {@link #initializeGameWithInitialState(State)} method before recording any further transitions. Transitions should then be recorded with the
 * {@link #recordTransitionTo(JointAction, State, Map)} method which takes as input the next state to which the agent transtions, the joint action taken
 * in the previously recorded state that causes the transition, and the joint reward received for the transition.
 * <p>
 * When querying about the state, joint action, or joint rewards, use the methods {@link #getState(int)}, {@link #getJointAction(int)}, and {@link #getJointReward(int)}
 * respectively.
 * These methods take as input the time step of the element you want. Note that t = 0 refers to the initial state step so calling getState(0) and getJointAction(0)
 * will return the initial state and the joint action taken in the initial state, respectively. However, joint rewards are always received in the next time step
 * from the state and action that produced them. Therefore, getJointReward(0) is undefined. Instead, the first reward received will be at time step 1: getReward(1).
 * Additionally, the action and reward for a specific agent in a specific time step can be queried with {@link #getActionForAgent(int, String)} and
 * {@link #getRewardForAgent(int, String)}, respectively.
