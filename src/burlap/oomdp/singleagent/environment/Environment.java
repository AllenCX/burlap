/**
 * Environments define a current state and manage state and reward transitions when an action is executed in the environment through
 * the {@link #executeAction(burlap.oomdp.singleagent.GroundedAction)} method. {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment}
 * instances are what learning algorithms implementing {@link burlap.behavior.singleagent.learning.LearningAgent} interact with
 * the environment around them. Maintaining an Environment ensures that transitions are protected from an agent manipulating the state
 * and are also useful when a BURLAP agent is interacting with external or real time systems such as robotics. Environments
 * also make it easy to use a planning algorithm to compute a {@link burlap.behavior.policy.Policy} using some model of the world
 * and then have that policy executed in an {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment} that may behave differently
 * than the model (e.g., robotics operating in the real world). {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment} implementations
 * also make it easy to train a {@link burlap.behavior.singleagent.learning.LearningAgent} in one {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment}
 * and then use them in a new {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.Environment} after learning.
 * <br/><br/>
 * If you wish to use a simulated BURLAP {@link burlap.oomdp.core.Domain} to manage the transitions and reward function, you should
 * consider using the {@link burlap.oomdp.singleagent.environment.SimulatedEnvironment} implementation.
