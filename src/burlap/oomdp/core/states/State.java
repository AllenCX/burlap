/**
 * A State instance is used to define the state of an environment or an observation from the environment. Creating
 * a state requires implementing three methods to ensure compatibility with all BURLAP tools. First, the
 * {@link #getVariableKeys()} method should return a list of objects that represent the possible keys that are used
 * to reference state variables in your state. In general, a state variable is any value that when changed alters
 * the identification of the state. That is, two states with different state variables would not be equal and transition
 * dynamics and reward functions from them may be different as a result.
 * <br><br>
 * Next the {@link #get(Object)} method should accept any argument that is listed in the {@link #variableKeys()} list
 * and should return the value of that variable. You do *not* have to guarantee that changes the client makes to the
 * returned value will affect the state. In fact, in general, clients should only modify state objects if they
 * implement the MutableState interface through its set method.
 * <br><br>
 * Finally, the {@link #copy()} method must be implemented so that a duplicate copy of this state. If the state
 * implements MutableState, then a copied state should have the property that changes made to copy do
 * not affect the values of the source state, so make sure copies are as deep as necessary.
